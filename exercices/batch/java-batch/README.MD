# java-training

## Pure Java Batch for training purposes

### Objective
In this Batch we have a simple java structure. The objective is to practice java good practices
and code, such as:

- Primitive variables;
- Conditional statements: (if, while, for, ...)
- Object orientation;
- Heritage;
- File handling;


    src -> The source code where we will implement the code. Only a Main class is given, from where the process must be started;
    input -> Folder with the input content that will be read by the batch;
    output -> Folder where we will write the output content;

### Exercise 1

In the input folder, there are two .csv files(hWich can be read by MS Excel for a more human readibility) with
a list of dogs info: ID, Name, Chip number, Mom Chip Number, Dad Chip Number.

1. Write code that can read the files (both of them!) from the input folder and output it to console;
2. Output the whole List to a single file in the output folder;

Hints:
- Object orientation is heavily recommended (another way to say it: A MUST HAVE!!!);
- Check java.nio.file.* for file reading;

### Exercise 2

(In the oven! But will use the code from the first exercise.........)
